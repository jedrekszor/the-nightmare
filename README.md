### About game
The siblings wake up in the nightmare that takes place in the astral version of their home. To get out of it, they have to work together in a fight against the monsters that emerge from the darkness. Children know that monsters will attack at midnight. They have to find the right toys and prepare their home to fight them. Any nightmare can be controlled, so they use their imagination to turn their toys into weapons. Children will only get out of the nightmare if they keep the light on in their rooms.
